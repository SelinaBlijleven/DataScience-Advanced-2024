# Python Data Science Advanced 05â€“2024

This repository contains the examples and sources (as well as some additional sources) for the Data Science Advanced training 
occurring in May 2024.

## Sources

### Datasets

- [Pearson Father & Son dataset](https://mathstat.slu.edu/~clair/stat1300/data/pearson-father-son.csv)

### Practice

The following section contains some online interactive learning materials.

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/): Kaggle is a website with many datasets, interactive learning materials and even competitions. Especially their interactive machine learning courses are a great way to practice the material.
- [RAWgraphs](https://www.rawgraphs.io/): Online visualization tool for quick exploration.
- [drawdata.xyz](https://drawdata.xyz/): This website allows you to draw your own data points, which are great for practicing with machine learning. (Tip: pandas has read CSV from clipboard functionality)
